# A Comparison Between Recurrent and Non-recurrent Deep Q-Networks in a GridWorld Survival Game

## Description

This repository contains code we implemented as part of the couse project for the course CMSC 727: Neural Modelling taught by James Reggia at University of Maryland, College Park. 

We implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm to examine the the discrepancy between recurrent and non-recurrent neural
networks for the purpose of Q-learning in a survival-focused GridWorld game. Our study compared the two architectures’ ability to guarantee a
high rate of “survival” (subject to our definition of this objective) in randomly generated grid environments that share basic inherent properties.

A description of the various files uploaded is as follows:

1. The file ```grid.py``` generates a two-dimensional grid wolrd populated with the virtual agent, enemies, food and obstacles/walls.
